                <p class="tr-non-selectable tr-no-focus tr-text-sm tr-font-abl tr-text-justify">The Department of Computer Science and Engineering was established in 1992. It started functioning in the Department of Physics, University of Kalyani, with only one course and that was Postgraduate Diploma in Computer Application (PGDCA) with student strength of fifteen. Subsequently, at the end of 2002, the Department started functioning in its new building. The two existing courses, Master in Computer Application (MCA) and Master of Technology in Computer Science (M.Tech.) were started from 2001 and 2003 respectively. The department also offers Ph.D. in different areas of computer science and its applications.</p>

                <p class="tr-non-selectable tr-no-focus tr-text-sm tr-font-abl tr-text-justify">The department currently has six efficient faculty members and five other staffs to run the courses smoothly. Healthy teacher-student relationship and well equipped laboratories have paved the way towards growth in the IT sector. The department also recognizes the importance of Information Technology in the modern world and is dedicated towards making all possible efforts to place its students in the run. The passing students have a very well track record of getting placed in reputed companies and in various research and academic institutes, both in India and abroad.</p>
